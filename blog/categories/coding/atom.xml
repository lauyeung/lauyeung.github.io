    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The more I pair program, the more I enjoy it. It&rsquo;s very much like sharing the platform with a buddy. Here are a few pros I&rsquo;ve found:</p>

<p><strong>Pacing</strong>: Sharing the platform makes it easier to time when you should be lifting &ndash; it&rsquo;s much easier to prevent your breaks between sets from being too short or too long. Similarly, pair programming can helps pace yourself&mdash;just having someone to talk about your code to helps you talk through your process and think it through.</p>

<p><strong>Staying Focused</strong>: Having a friend can keep you from getting distracted and keep you on task and in the zone.</p>

<p><strong>Share the Knowledge</strong>: I always learn something new from my partner. Whether it&rsquo;s a lifehack, computer shortcut, or a tip for just doing it better. It&rsquo;s always an educational experience to work with someone.</p>

<p>Pairing can be very uncomfortable at because it requires you try to accomodate someone else&rsquo;s working style and having someone watch you work, but there are some definite benefits. And as with a lot of things, practice helps! Looking forward to more pairing in my life.</p>
